                <p>I did my ksce in 2014 and scored C plain, I felt like my life had no meaning because I had missed the
                    minimum points to go University and my parents are poor!
                    I later hard about Uwezo College in machakos and applied to do diploma in food and beverage ,
                    production and service. After 3 years I completed my final Knec diploma exams and scored
                    distinction! Uwezo college helped to get my first job in a high end hotel in nairobi where I worked
                    for 2 years and then decided to open my own restaurant in Katangi.
                    My business is doing very well and I am thankfull to God and Uwezo College for my success. Uwezo
                    College indeed lives its motto of beyond training!
