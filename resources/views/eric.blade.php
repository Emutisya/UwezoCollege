                <p>I did my KCSE in 2016,although I did not get the grade I hoped for,I did not give up on my dreams for
                    I knew I had to make a choice to get a chance and change everything.
                    Later on I joined Uwezo College(The place to be) and pursed a Craft Certificate in Food and Beverage
                    Production,Sales and Service.The Lord helped me and I completed my two years with a strong credit in
                    module one(production) and a distinction in module two(service).
                    I was able to secure a job at a Company called Atoz services located in qatar as a waiter.
                    Today, am grateful and happy because I will be pursuing my dreams abroad(qatar).This is a result of
                    my hardwork, discipline,the help of my tutors and off course the help of God.


                    Indeed,Am proud of Uwezo College the school of choice. </p>
