                <p>I did my KCSE in 2015 and scored a C plain, I felt as if my life had no meaning because I had
                    missed the minimum points required to enroll in an university and I come from a humble
                    background.
                    I later heard of Uwezo College in machachos and applied to do a diploma in social work and
                    community development, after three years I completed my final KNEC diploma exams and scored a
                    distinction!
                    During my training I found Uwezo College a good institutuion with a condusive leraning
                    enviroment with execellent tutors, after the completion of my diploma, I've worked with the
                    ministry of labour and social protection, the state department of children services before
                    shifting to UTWEMA NGO.
                    Currently I am also pursuing my degree in phychology at Masinde Muliru University of Science and
                    Technology.


                    I would highly recommend aspiring students to join Uwezo College to better their future! Uwezo
                    College goes beyond training! </p>
