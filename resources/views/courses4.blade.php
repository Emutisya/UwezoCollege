                <p>Uwezo College from the outset identified social work and community development
                    as an area lacking in properly trained professionals based on a number of media
                    reports on mistreatment of the sick, elderly, special needs children, HIV aids
                    victims etc

                    <p>Social and Community Development is a course that covers a wide range of
                        contemporary subjects and topics. What these things have in common is that they
                        will help one to tackle the social problems that matter most such as homelessness,
                        drug-use, violence, mental health, and many more.</p>
                    <p>TSocial workers are responsible for helping individuals, families, and groups of
                        people to cope with problems they&#39;re facing to improve their patients&#39; lives. One
                        aspect of this is teaching skills and developing mechanisms for patients to rely on
                        to better their lives and experiences.</p>

                    <p>Community development usually has three major elements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>community
                            members&#39; well-being or welfare involving both material sufficiency and non-
                            economic aspects of living such as health and education;</li>
                        <li>resource development,
                            involving increased production and efficiency;</li>
                        <li>organizational development</li>


                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>Upon completion of the prescribed course of study for Diploma in Community
                    Development and Social Work the graduate will have acquired knowledge, skills
                    and abilities to be able to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use development knowledge skills and abilities attained to support Development organizations
                            control principles and procedures;</li>
                        <li>Describe development concepts, principles and procedures in development
                            organisations</li>
                        <li>Select and apply development paradigms in appropriate development
                            situations;</li>
                        <li>Apply various development skills to solve problems in various economics,
                            political and social areas</li>

                    </ul>
                </p>
